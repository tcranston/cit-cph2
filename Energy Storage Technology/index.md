At CPH2, we have developed the capability to engineer hydrogen-based energy storage systems as a clean alternative to battery-power storage systems which are being increasingly used to stabilise and strengthen electricity transmission and distribution networks. 
The CPH2 solution is a set of scaleable processes, systems and technologies which have been developed for efficient electrolysis, drying, purification  and separation of hydrogen (from oxygen) and storage.

In GB, the solution can be applied to overcome local network constraints, and to provide a revenue stream through PPAs, frequency response, STOR, Triad, and other emerging market opportunities
The equipment design is highly flexible design and can be tailored to chosen site and specific requirements for operation in the chosen markets. It can provide a clean and economic addition to the power sector’s portfolio of balancing solutions
Our solution is equally applicable to on-grid and off-grid requirements, UK and worldwide. We can offer cross-energy vector flexibility and arbitrage value in use of hydrogen between electricity generation and fuelling hydrogen vehicles
In summary, CPH2’s hydrogen systems provide a viable, cost effective and low-carbon alternative to batteries for technology-agnostic applications, with many distinct advantages:

 - Competes favourably on economic and environmental grounds against battery solutions and other means of hydrogen production
 - Environmentally-friendly, as the only consumables are electricity and water with no degradation over time and  use
 - Design life is 30 years for a system which is also not prone to early failure
 - Additional storage capacity is  low cost and a small proportion of the total project cost
 - There is only a very small reduction in performance over life
 - Increasingly rare precious metals are not required
 - Oxygen is a valued by-product
 - The system is significantly less expensive than its competitors
 - Operations and maintenance are low cost and straightforward
