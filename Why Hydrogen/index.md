CPH2’s core technology is the efficient production of hydrogen by electrolysis and its ability to combine this with other technologies to provide a range of commercial products. 

But why Hydrogen?

Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe and is the third most abundant element on the Earth’s surface, mainly in the forms of water and hydrocarbons.  Hydrogen as a gas is highly flammable and will burn in air at a wide range of concentrations between 4% and 75% by volume.  The temperature of spontaneous ignition in air is 500°C (932°F).  When hydrogen burns, it reacts with the oxygen to form water.

The many uses of hydrogen as an energy carrier include wide-ranging applications such as decarbonisation of the gas grid,  electricity generation from stored hydrogen, and a rapidly increasing role in transport where hydrogen-fuelled electric vehicles are been developed for worldwide markets alongside battery-power electric vehicles Storage techniques have advanced considerably and the gas is regularly stored and used world-wide.

Much of the hydrogen production by electrolysis utilises Proton Exchange Membranes (PEM).  These systems use expensive components and require considerable upkeep.  This has restricted the use as a fuel to a relatively small number of opportunities.

CPH2 has taken the centuries-old process of electrolysis of water, and improved its efficiency.  The current applications are emissions reduction and energy storage.
