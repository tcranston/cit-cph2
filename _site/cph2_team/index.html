        <h1>CPH2 Team</h1>

        <h2 id="clive-brook--chairman-and-cfo">Clive Brook – Chairman and CFO</h2>
<p>Clive qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1973 and since then has had a wide range of commercial &amp; financial experience, having worked in industry, venture capital (where was a main-board director of 3i plc, then the UK’s largest venture capital business) and corporate finance. His role in CPH2 is to spearhead long term strategic development, provide team leadership, locate and negotiate finance and ensure proper corporate governance and accounting protocols are enacted.  He has considerable experience in early stage businesses and in raising capital for such businesses. He has also advised the UK government and various other public sector bodies, mainly in relation to SME development and venture capital.  He is a Director of The North West Fund, a £155 million venture capital fund utilising ERDF and EIB money, which has to be invested in SMEs in the North West of England. This fund has an Energy &amp; Environmental sub-fund, with which Clive has been closely associated. He also runs an FCA regulated corporate finance business which has energy clients.</p>

<h2 id="nigel-williamson---technology-director">Nigel Williamson - Technology Director</h2>
<p>Nigel spent his early career developing fluid sealing technologies.  He worked for Dunlop Hydraulic Hose Division in Sheffield and then the USA, was granted numerous patents and the customers included NASA, General Dynamics, Moog, Rolls Royce, Alstom, General Motors, Ford Chrysler, VW/Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, TRW, Bosch, Delphi, Case, Deere and Terex.  Following this, he established NWD International, Inc in Michigan, USA, (57 employees) which he ran until the expiration of his visa and then became General Manager of a factory in Born, NL (115 employees), both companies supplying sealing technologies to Automotive Industry OEMs.  A shift in technology took him to the hydrogen sector where he worked for 5 years as Chief Engineer at ITM Power Plc in Sheffield, helping the company become the largest electrolyser development company in Europe.  On leaving ITM he developed the low cost and robust electrolysis process which is the core technology of Clean Power Hydrogen for Low Emissions Technology and Energy Storage Technology.</p>

<h2 id="charles-monroe--engineering-director">Charles Monroe – Engineering Director</h2>
<p>Charles Monroe has worked as an engineer in the cryogenic sector for over twenty five years.  After graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in Engineering he qualified as a Chartered Engineer with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and in 2006 he was elected a Fellow.  His first job in 1984 was with Oxford Instruments designing and building liquid helium cooled superconducting magnets.  He followed this with two positions at Air Products and then Sapio Srl in Italy to develop new technologies using liquid nitrogen, typically for the pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies.  Since 1997 he has run his own engineering consultancy business.  The clients have included companies and government research establishments in Europe and North America.  The applications have included cryogenic cooling systems for research laoratories, instruments for the science sector, carbon capture and storage, clean-up systems for storage waste generated during the decommissioning of nuclear power stations and the cooling equipment for fusion power technologies.</p>

<h2 id="rodney-brook---director">Rodney Brook - Director</h2>
<p>Rodney Brook graduated from Imperial College in electrical engineering and is a Chartered Engineer. His 30-year career with Eastern Electricity and various successor companies has included senior roles in R&amp;D, power networks design and operations, General Management,  Health &amp; Safety and  IT.  He has also held a broad and deep knowledge of requirements for system balance and managing power on electricity distribution networks. His work with Eastern and TXU following the development of competitive electricity markets included roles in regulatory, technical and commercial activity relating to the supply, trading and balancing of electricity. For the past 15 years Rodney has been working in in energy consultancy as a Founder-Director of Sohn Associates Ltd.</p>

<h2 id="joe-scott--non-executive-director">Joe Scott – Non-Executive Director</h2>
<p>Joe is a qualified Production Engineer, having started out with Ford. He specialised in research &amp; development of advanced machining technology (‘EDM’). His entrepreneurial drive led him to establish his own tool and mould making company, in which he developed the first CAD/CAM-based paperless toolmaking processes. His customers included Motorola, Apple, Intel etc. The business’ unique selling proposition was its reduction in lead times from 16 weeks to 6 weeks.
These clients required his business also to produce mouldings on a similar timescale; this required a high level of robotics, providing a cost effective offering compared with Far Eastern manufacturers.  He still owns and runs this business which continues to thrive. As Joe’s strength is in product development &amp; design, when CPH2 required innovative designs for its electolyser process, it turned to Joe to provide the most cost-effective solution. He has funded, through his other business, the development of an on-vehicle electrolysis technology, and is committed to providing a high level of input, both on the product design, development aspects, and also on commercial matters.</p>
