On leaving ITM he developed the lower cost and robust electrolysis process which is the core technology of Clean Power Hydrogen for Low Emissions Technology and Energy Storage Technology.

Charles Monroe – Engineering Director
------------------------------
Charles Monroe has worked as an engineer in the cryogenic sector for over twenty five years.  After graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in Engineering he qualified as a Chartered Engineer with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and in 2006 he was elected a Fellow.  His first job in 1984 was with Oxford Instruments designing and building liquid helium cooled superconducting magnets.  He followed this with two positions at Air Products and then Sapio Srl in Italy to develop new technologies using liquid nitrogen, typically for the pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies.  Since 1997 he has run his own engineering consultancy business.  The clients have included companies and government research establishments in Europ and North America.  The applications have included cryogenic cooling systems for research laoratories, instruments for the science sector, carbon capture and storage, clean-up systems for storage waste generated during the decommissioning of nuclear power stations and the cooling equipment for fusion power technologies.

Rodney Brook - Director
------------------------------
Rodney Brook graduated from Imperial College in electrical engineering and is a Chartered Engineer. His 30-year career with Eastern Electricity and various successor companies has included senior roles in R&D, power networks design and operations, General Management,  Health & Safety and  IT.

Joe Scott – Non-Executive Director
------------------------------
Joe is a qualified Production Engineer, having started out with Ford. He specialised in research & development of advanced machining technology (‘EDM’). His entrepreneurial drive led him to establish his own tool and mould making company, in which he developed the first CAD/CAM-based paperless toolmaking processes. His customers included Motorola, Apple, Intel etc. The business’ unique selling proposition was its reduction in lead times from 16 weeks to 6 weeks.
These clients required his business also to produce mouldings on a similar timescale; this required a high level of robotics, providing a cost effective offering compared with Far Eastern manufacturers.  He still owns and runs this business which continues to thrive. As Joe’s strength is in product development & design, when CPH2 required innovative designs for its electolyser process, it turned to Joe to provide the most cost-effective solution. He has funded, through his other business, the development of an on-vehicle electrolysis technology, and is committed to providing a high level of input, both on the product design, development aspects, and also on commercial matters.
