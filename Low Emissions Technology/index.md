In addition to its range of Energy Storage Technologies, CPH2 has developed two systems for improved performance of internal combustion engines on  vehicles and as used to drive electricity generators.
There is growing interest in the retrofit of CPH2’s LET devices, driven by increasing concerns in many countries of harmful emissions (especially from diesel engines), and by business and regulatory incentives to reduce fuel consumption and corresponding CO2  emissions. 

The gas generation system
-------------------------

The CPH2 gas generation system is a fully integrated self-monitoring unit, designed to provide a variable volume of hydrogen and oxygen gases in a 2:1 ratio from water.
The system draws electricity of low current at 12V or 24V DC, dependent upon the vehicle’s electrical system. The electrical power is applied to our ‘stack’ which separates the water into its constituent gases by a highly efficient electrolysis process. Only sufficient gas to address the engine’s needs is produced in ‘real- time’ as the vehicle engine runs.  There is no gas stored on the vehicle, making it very compact.

The system, which uses very little water, produces enough gas for most applications. Water can be supplied automatically from a reservoir of any chosen size in a location anywhere on the vehicle.  This reduces the number of topping-up operations required in a year.  Should the reservoir be depleted without being noticed, the system will shut down until it is refilled.  A warning system advising that a top-up of the main reservoir is required can also be fitted.

Theory
------
The CPH2 system’s effectiveness is related to the speed of the combustion reaction of hydrogen, which is around seven times that of diesel.  A tiny explosion of the hydrogen and oxygen occurs early in the diesel combustion reaction, further breaking up the droplets of diesel fuel injected into the engine.  This offers a much smaller droplet (and significantly higher surface area) to the oxygen for a more complete combustion.  The same benefits are derived when using the technology on petrol engines.
This results in more power output from the engine, and contributes to lower emissions of particulates and gaseous hydrocarbons, better fuel consumption and reduced CO2 emissions.

Misting system 
--------------
The most recent development within CPH2’s product range is a patented misting system which provides even greater improvement in the efficiency of diesel combustion.  This is additional technology which may either be kept separate or combined with the electrolysis technology to directly address NOx generation. Rather than attempting to reduce NOx emissions post-combustion, our approach is to reduce the generation of NOx in the combustion reaction, thereby reducing and potentially eliminating the need for AdBlue or other post-combustion additives which can give rise to other issues.
With this technology we have achieved an immediate reduction in NOx emissions.
